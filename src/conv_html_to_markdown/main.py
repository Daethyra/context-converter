"""
This module serves as the main entry point for the HTML to Markdown conversion project.

It contains the main function which loads, processes, and saves the dataset. The processing involves converting HTML content to Markdown and formatting it into a structured form. The dataset is processed in chunks to optimize memory usage and performance.

The module also includes functions for processing individual chunks of the dataset and for processing and collecting data from all chunks in parallel using multithreading.

Functions:
    process_dataset_chunk(chunk): Processes a single chunk of the dataset.
    main(): Main function to load, process, and save the dataset.
